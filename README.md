This template creates a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16 and public internet capabilities through the creation of a public subnet with CIDR block 10.0.1.0/24, an internet gateway, a VPC gateway attachment, and a route table with a default route to the internet gateway. Additionally, a security group is created to allow incoming traffic on SSH and HTTP ports.
